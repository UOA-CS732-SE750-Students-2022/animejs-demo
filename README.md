This repo is a demo of the AnimeJS animation library to help you learn AnimeJS.

It has the following four folders, each of which contains one JS project. 

* **0-all-in-one-demo**: This demo animates a logo, it includes most of the core functionalities of AnimeJS in one animation sequence. 
* **1-basics**: This project includes the very basics of AnimeJS, e.g. how to animate a Translate
* **2-intermediate**: This project includes some stuff which are a bit more fun! Mainly, it introduces timelines and anime.stagger
* **3-advanced**: This project shows you how to animate along the path line. It animates the outline of a words to have a drawing effect. 


## To start

If you're here to learn AnimeJS, I suggest you start by looking at the **0-all-in-one-demo**, which is a small example of what you can make with AnimeJS. However, I don't recommend looking at the code quite yet! Before that, let's walk through **1-basics**, **2-intermediate**, and **3-advanced** (in that order), which will give you a good understanding of AnimeJS. Then you should look at **0-all-in-one-demo** and have a fiddle, and see what you can find!

### How to set up this repo?

Simply clone this repo, and open up each of the folders listed above. To see the animations, simply open the html file in a browser.
